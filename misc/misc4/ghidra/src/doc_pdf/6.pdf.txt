Docking Windows

Docking Windows 1/3

Ghidra tools provide various G
UI components that allow users
 to view and manage programs. 
The Docking Windows feature al
lows users to customize the
layout of these "Dockable" com
ponents within a Ghidra tool.

The Basic Dockable Component
The image below shows a tool w
ith three Dockable Components:
 Program Trees, Listing, and D
ata Type Manager.

Each component consist of seve
ral common parts:
Title Bar
The title bar is at the top of
 the component and displays th
e title of the window. It also
 serves as a handle for draggi
ng the component to other
positions within the tool. The
 title bar's color indicates w
hether the component has keybo
ard focus. When the component 
has focus, the title
bar is blue, otherwise it is g
ray. Only one component can ha
ve focus at a time.
Local Toolbar
The title bar also serves as a
 local toolbar. It contains ic
ons for actions that apply onl
y to this component. Hovering 
the mouse over an icon
causes a tool tip to be displa
yed. The tool tip give a hint 
as to what the action will do 
if you select the icon.

Menu Icon

Docking Windows 2/3

The menu icon will appear if t
he dockable component has a lo
cal menu. As with the local to
olbar, the local menu item app
lies only to this
component. Mouse click on the 
icon to show the menu.
Close Icon
Select
to hide the dockable component
. The component will be remove
d until you select the compone
nt's name from the tool's Wind
ow
menu. Some components, such as
 search results, are transient
 and are permanently removed w
hen you close these components
.
Work Area
The work area contains the spe
cific GUI component that is be
ing managed.

Arranging Components
Docking Windows allows users t
o arrange components into conf
igurations that best fit their
 needs. There are three ways c
omponents can be arranged in a
tool:
1. Docked with other component
s: components are side-by-side
 (or top to bottom) with anoth
er component.
2. Stacked with other componen
ts: components share the same 
space and tabs are used to dis
play them one at a time.
3. In their own window: a comp
onent can be placed in its own
 window.

Moving Components
Components can be rearranged b
y dragging them in various way
s. To drag a component, press 
and hold the left mouse button
 on the title bar
of the component to be moved a
nd begin moving the mouse. The
 mouse cursor will change to i
ndicate what will happen if th
e mouse button is
released at that location.
Invalid Location - releasing h
ere will cancel the drag opera
tion.
Will move the component to the
 left of the component that th
e mouse cursor is over.
Will move the component to the
 right of the component that t
he mouse cursor is over.
Will move the component above 
the component that the mouse c
ursor is over.
Will move the component below 
the component that the mouse c
ursor is over.
Will stack the component with 
the component that the mouse i
s over, creating a tabbed pane
 effect.
Will place the component in a 
new window.
To get the arrow cursors to ap
pear, move the mouse near the 
inside edge of another compone
nt. To get the stack cursor, m
ove the mouse
over the middle area of anothe
r component. To get the new wi
ndow cursor, move the mouse ov
er the desktop. The Invalid lo
cation cursor
will appear when the mouse is 
over the component being moved
.
Resizing components
Docked components are separate
d by thin borders. When the mo
use is moved over a border whi
ch separates two docked compon
ents, the
cursor will change to a resize
icon. To change the relative s
ize of the components, press t
he left mouse button while ove
r a border and drag
the border in the appropriate 
direction.

Renaming Components
Transient components (e.g., se
arch windows) can be renamed. 
Right-click on either the titl
e bar or tab of a transient wi
ndow and a popup menu item wil
l
appear that allows you to chan
ge the title of that component
. This can be useful when you 
wish to better identify search
 results when you have perform
ed
many searches.

Windows Menu

Docking Windows 3/3

Each component currently loade
d in the tool has a correspond
ing entry in the tool's Window
 menu. The menu item for a com
ponent can be used to show a
component that is currently no
t visible. If the component is
 already showing, it will be b
rought to the front (if it is 
behind some other component or
windows) and the component wil
l be made active (have keyboar
d focus). Temporary windows su
ch as search results are shown
 at the bottom of the menu
below the separator bar. Multi
ple windows of the same type a
re grouped into sub-menus. For
 example the following snapsho
t of a window menu
indicates there are several se
arch results windows open.
