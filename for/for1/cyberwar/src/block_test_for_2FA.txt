	The OVERLORD are approaching, this message is the last way we will be able to contact our brothers and sister in the resistance. Our stronghold has been weakended and we fear food and water rations will run out soon. The weapon situation is worse. Our last plasma rifle has broken and is beyond repair. The techwear we rely on for personal shielding protection is gaining more and more wear by the day. Our situation is grim, I hope this message finds the resistance, I am heavily encrypting it. When you arrive at our new stronghold you will need to use the password "toor" to gain entrance. Our location will be passed along in another form to ensure maximum protection. Godspeed.
